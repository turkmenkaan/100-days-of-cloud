# Beginning the Journey

## Day 1

This is my first day of 100 Days of Cloud challenge. I've started of with some relaxed studying. 

I learned about available compute, storage, networking and artificial intelligence services on Azure. Can't wait to use Azure Functions to implement serverless functions. 

To learn about overview of various services Azure offers, Microsoft Learn seems like the best option.

I've also worked on some practice questions from ITExams to test my progress.
