# Day 2 - Azure Security

Today, I went through the part 4 of [Azure Fundamentals by MS Learn](https://aka.ms/azfunpath). Part 4 is about my favorite subject, security. Before starting this journey, I was spending most of my time expanding my knowledge and experience in cybersecurity. I hope to utilize the knowledge I acquired in my cloud studies. 

Today I learned about: 
- **Azure Security Center**: This is pretty much like an on-cloud Security Operations Center (SOC). It is a monitoring service that provides visibility for the security posture of resources.
- **Azure Sentinel**: Sentinel collects data from all points of your cloud architecture. It can be called the SIEM of the cloud.
- **Azure Key Vault**: Centralized cloud service for storing secrets such as passwords, API keys, certificats etc.
- **Azure Dedicated Hosts**: If for compliance or any other reason you need your application to be the sole application running on that particular hardware, you can achieve this through Dedicated Hosts.
- **Azure Firewall**: Azure's Firewall service that helps protect resources in Azure Virtual Networks. 
- **Azure DDoS Protection**: Denial of Service protection. It offers two tiers. Basic tier is free and automatically enabled in for your services. Standard tier provides some additional mitigation capabilities, but not free.
- **Network Security Groups**: These can be used as internal firewalls. They can manage and block the internal traffic between different resources.
