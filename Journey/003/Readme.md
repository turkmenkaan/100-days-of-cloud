# Day 3 - Identity, Governance, Privacy

Today's study material was the forth part of MS Learn Azure Fundamentals. This part is about identity, governance and privacy. In this part I learned about the Azure service that is used to migrate a very widely used enterprise solution to cloud, Active Directory. I have also learned about Azure's authentication and authorization systems. 

I have also learned about Role-Based Access Control and Resource Locks, which are important tools to compartmentalize organizations and avoid costly mistakes.
